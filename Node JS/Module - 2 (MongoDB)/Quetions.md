## Q-1

### What is MongoDB.

=> MongoDB is a popular, open-source, no SQL database that provides a flexible and scalable way to store and manage data.
=> It is designed to handle large volume of unstructured data.
=> It is widely used in modern web and mobile application.

► Features of MongoDB :

• NoSQL database:
=> Unlike traditional relational databases like MySQL, MongoDB does not use tables and rows.
=> Data is stored in a document-oriented format using JSON like BSON documents.

• Scalability :
=> Supports horizontal scaling through sharding, distributing data across multiple servers to handle large datasets.

• High Performance:
=> Optimized for read and write operations, making it suitable for real-time applications.

• Schema Flexibility:
=> MongoDB allows you to store data without a fixed schema, making it easy to accommodate changes in data structure over time.

## Q-2

### What is difference between mongo DB and SQL

► MongoDB :
=> NoSQL (non-relational) database.
=> Stored data as document in a JSON like format BSON.
=> Schema is flexible; documents within a collection can have different fields and structures.
=> Designed for horizontal scaling.
=> Uses a rich, flexible query language with JSON-like syntax for querying and aggregation.

► SQL Database :
=> Relational Database.
=> Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
=> Schema is rigid; all rows in a table must conform to a predefined structure.
=> Typically rely on vertical scaling.
=> Use Structured Query Language (SQL), a standardized language for defining, manipulating, and querying data.
